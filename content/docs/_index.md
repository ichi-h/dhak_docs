## What is Dhak?

Dhak is a CUI/GUI application to manage your passwords.

Dhak combines your original passphrase with the name of the service that requires a password, hashes it, and uses the value as the new password. In this way, you can manage your passwords without keeping them anywhere.

If you want to try Dhak immediately, please read [Installation](/dhak_docs/docs/installation).  
If you want to know more about Dhak works, please read [Security](/dhak_docs/docs/security).
